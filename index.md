## Welcome to GitHub Pages

### This is my **first** attempt at using GitHub Pages

I have used GitHub for other classes *but* I've yet to use this feature for anything.
It seems like there could be many useful features for GitHub Pages such as:
* Creating a personalized website easily
* Storing all your repos in a nicer manner
* Managing files and the like
* And so much more!

As a final ending note, I'd like to leave this here:
